SUMMARY:
========
Total unused functions found: 35
Files with most unused functions:
1. src/seg_cells.py: 13 unused functions
2. src/try_blobs.py: 11 unused functions  
3. utils/preprocessing.py: 6 unused functions
4. experiment/improve_quality.py: 3 unused functions
5. src/find_size.py: 4 unused functions
6. src/combine_predictions_to_table.py: 2 unused functions

These functions appear to be:
- Legacy code from development/testing
- Alternative implementations not used in final pipeline
- Debug/visualization functions
- Utility functions that were planned but not integrated
- Functions for features not yet implemented

Recommendation: Review each unused function to determine if it should be:
- Removed (if truly obsolete)
- Moved to a utilities module (if potentially useful)
- Integrated into the pipeline (if needed functionality)
- Kept for future development (if planned features)
